## üì± Step 1: Download the Project

### Option A: Download ZIP (Easiest)
1. Go to: https://github.com/BlockchainHB/KijijiBot
2. Click the green **"Code"** button
3. Click **"Download ZIP"**
4. Extract the ZIP file to your Desktop
5. Rename the folder to just **"KijijiBot"**

### Option B: Use Git (If you know how)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlockchainHB/KijijiBot.git
cd KijijiBot
```

---

## üíª Step 2: Install Python

### For Mac Users:
1. Open **Terminal** (press Cmd+Space, type "terminal", press Enter)
2. Type this command and press Enter:
   ```bash
   brew install python3
   ```
   If you get an error, first install Homebrew by copying this entire line:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

### For Windows Users:
1. Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download **Python 3.11** or newer
3. **IMPORTANT**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
4. Click **"Install Now"**

### Test Python Installation:
Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type:
```bash
python3 --version
```
You should see something like "Python 3.11.5"

---

## üìÅ Step 3: Navigate to Your Project

1. Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
2. Navigate to where you downloaded KijijiBot:

**Mac:**
```bash
cd Desktop/KijijiBot
```

**Windows:**
```bash
cd Desktop\KijijiBot
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è Step 4: Set Up the Environment

Copy and paste these commands one by one:

### Create Virtual Environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### Activate Virtual Environment:

**Mac:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command line now.

### Install Required Packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install Browser:
```bash
playwright install chromium
```

---

## üîê Step 5: Add Your Kijiji Login Information

1. In the KijijiBot folder, find the file called **`config.example.json`**
2. **Copy** this file
3. **Rename** the copy to **`test_input.json`**
4. Open **`test_input.json`** with any text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, etc.)
5. Replace the placeholder information:

```json
{
    "username": "youremail@gmail.com",
    "password": "YourKijijiPassword123",
    "headless": false,
    "location": "Your Street Address, Your City",
    "phone": "647-XXX-XXXX"
}
```

**Example:**
```json
{
    "username": "john.doe@gmail.com",
    "password": "MySecretPassword123",
    "headless": false,
    "location": "123 Main Street, Toronto",
    "phone": "647-555-1234"
}
```

**Important Security Notes:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never share this file with anyone**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **This file contains your password**
- ‚úÖ The file is automatically ignored by Git for safety

## üì∏ Step 6: Add Your Room Photos

You need **12 total photos** (6 for each ad):

### Create Photo Folders:
The folders should already exist, but if not:
1. Go to the **`images`** folder in KijijiBot
2. Make sure you have these folders:
   - **`images/ad1/`** (for professional ad)
   - **`images/ad2/`** (for student ad)

### Add Photos for Ad 1 (Professional Ad):
Put these 6 photos in **`images/ad1/`**:
- **`room_main.png`** - Main room view (clean, professional-looking)
- **`bed_area.png`** - Bed area (neat, well-made bed)
- **`workspace.png`** - Desk/work area (good lighting, organized)
- **`kitchen.png`** - Kitchen access (clean, modern)
- **`bathroom.png`** - Bathroom (clean, well-lit)
- **`exterior.png`** - House exterior (nice neighborhood view)

### Add Photos for Ad 2 (Student Ad):
Put these 6 photos in **`images/ad2/`**:
- **`room_study.png`** - Room as study space (desk prominent)
- **`bed_desk.png`** - Bed and desk combo view
- **`living_space.png`** - Common living area (comfortable, casual)
- **`kitchen_shared.png`** - Shared kitchen (student-friendly)
- **`bathroom_clean.png`** - Clean bathroom (different angle than ad1)
- **`building.png`** - Building exterior (different angle than ad1)

### Photo Tips:
- ‚úÖ Take photos in **good lighting** (daytime, windows open)
- ‚úÖ **Clean up** the room before taking photos
- ‚úÖ Use **different angles** for each ad to avoid duplicate detection
- ‚úÖ **PNG or JPG format** only
- ‚úÖ Keep files **under 10MB** each
- ‚úÖ Use **descriptive file names** exactly as listed above

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è Step 7: Customize Your Ad Content

1. Open **`kijiji_dual_posting.py`** in a text editor
2. Find the sections that start with `self.ad1 = {` and `self.ad2 = {`
3. Update these fields to match your room:

### Ad 1 (Professional Focus):
```python
'title': 'Your Professional Room Title Here',  # Keep under 100 characters
'description': '''YOUR ROOM DESCRIPTION HERE
- What's included
- Location benefits  
- Ideal for professionals''',
'price': '500',  # Your price for professionals
'phone': '647-XXX-XXXX'  # Your phone number
```

### Ad 2 (Student Focus):
```python
'title': 'Your Student Room Title Here',  # Keep under 100 characters  
'description': '''YOUR STUDENT-FRIENDLY DESCRIPTION HERE
- Student amenities
- Near campus/transit
- Student-friendly price''',
'price': '450',  # Your student price
'phone': '647-XXX-XXXX'  # Your phone number
```

### Content Writing Tips:
- ‚úÖ **Keep titles under 100 characters**
- ‚úÖ **Keep descriptions under 4000 characters**
- ‚úÖ **Use bullet points** for easy reading

## üß™ Step 8: Test Run (Very Important!)

Before automating, always test manually:

### Make Sure Environment is Active:
You should see `(venv)` in your terminal. If not:

**Mac:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Run Test:
```bash
python kijiji_dual_posting.py
```

### What Should Happen:
1. **Browser opens** (you'll see it working)
2. **Logs into Kijiji** with your credentials
3. **Deletes old ads** (if any exist)
4. **Posts first ad** with ad1 photos
5. **Posts second ad** with ad2 photos
6. **Shows success message**

### If Something Goes Wrong:
- ‚ùå **Login fails**: Check your username/password in `test_input.json`
- ‚ùå **Images don't upload**: Check file names and formats
- ‚ùå **Ads don't post**: Check your Kijiji account status
- ‚ùå **Browser crashes**: Try restarting and running again
